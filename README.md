## Usage

Once running, OABTray will appear in your system tray with the Bitcoin symbol (â‚¿). The tray icon will display the current Bitcoin price and 24-hour percentage change.

- Click on the tray icon to see more options.
- You can adjust the ALABA_FACTOR, which determines the threshold for special animations.
- The app updates the price every 5 minutes.

## Configuration

The ALABA_FACTOR can be set to one of the following values: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3. This factor determines how sensitive the app is to price changes:

- When the price change percentage exceeds the positive ALABA_FACTOR, you'll see a "ALABADOOOOOOOO" animation.
- When it falls below the negative ALABA_FACTOR, you'll see a "PUTA MADRE" animation.
